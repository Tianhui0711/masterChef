## Project Summary
**Project name:** Master Chef  
Our project will provide a platform for people to share their daily meals and recipes. You can post your recipes including photos and detailed steps, or create a list to mark your favorite recipes. You will receive likes and comments from other users to what you post. We also want to make a recommendation page to show todayâ€™s top recipes.  

The project is built on MERN stack, and we use **Ant Design UI** as the 3rd party libraries to help built UI.
